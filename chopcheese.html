    <h1>Chop Cheese</h1>
    <img src="images/chopcheese.jpg">

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Chopped cheese, also known as "a chop cheese", is a type of sandwich originating from New York City. Found in bodegas throughout the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, it is made on a grill with ground beef, onions, and topped by melted cheese and served with lettuce, tomatoes, and condiments on a hero roll. It is compared with the cheesesteak, and a cheese sloppy joe, often thought of as a mixture of both, and is said to represent the culture of New York.</p>
